## Technologies

- **M** = MongoDB (We'll use Mongoose to make it easier for Node.js to work with MongoDB, and we'll use MongoDB Atlas = MongoDB database, but cloud).
- **E** = Express (makes it easier to work with Node.js).
- **R** = React (for the frontend. We'll use `bootstrap` for styling, `react-router-dom` for React routes and `fetch` to connect to the backend).
- **N** = Node.js (for the server. We'll use `dotenv` to load environment variables from an .env file into `process.env`, and `nodemon` to make the app auto-restart when you edit/save files).


## Installation
To just get it running after you `git clone`, set up [MongoDB Atlas] with data in `database` directory, and then follow these CLI steps, Install it locally using npm:

```bash
cd SocialCookii
npm run init-package
npm run dev


```
